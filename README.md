# Swift-TDD-Guide
This repository contains good practices and tricks you can use to be able to write unit testable code on iOS especially in Swift. 

In the first version it introduce two new assertions which are missing from XCTest:

1. `XCTAssertThrows()`

2. `XCTAssertDoesntThrow()`

They allow us to confirm that the method under test either throws or doesn't throw an exception.
